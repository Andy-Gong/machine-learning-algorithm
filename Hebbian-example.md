Hebbian learning NeuralNetwork

#### Hebbian theory

Hebbian theory is a theory in neuroscience that proposes an explanation for the adaptation of neurons in the brain during the learning process. It describes a basic mechanism for synaptic plasticity, where an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from the presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of the postsynaptic cell.

#### Algorithm

          ∆w_ij(p)=αx_i(p)y_j(p) - ϕw_ij(p)y_j, and α is rate of learning, ϕ is rate of forget
          
          w_ij(p+1)=w_ij(p)+∆w_ij(p)
